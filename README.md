# SyRaider üëæ
SyRaider is a program based on CMD, you can flood on 3 channels (can be on different servers), troll your friends' servers, creating an account and using it to raid.

# How to use ?
It's the same way you use SyFlood, look at my profile and look for SyFlood, which will teach you everything you need to know to be able to use it.

# Closed Source üñ•Ô∏è‚ùå
Unfortunately SyRaider is Closed Source, I will not open it to avoid people using it unethically and modifying it to be something extremely dangerous

# WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
Don't use SyRaider for evil, it's just a program to troll your friends, don't do this in communities you don't know and Raid/Flood/Spam is prohibited.
